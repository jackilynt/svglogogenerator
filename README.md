###### SVG Logo Generator ######
This is a logo generator application that allows users to create simple logos for their projects. It accepts user input for text, text color, shape, and shape color, and generates an SVG file with the specified logo.

###### User Story ######
As a freelance web developer, I want to generate a simple logo for my projects so that I don't have to pay a graphic designer.

###### Acceptance Criteria ######
The command-line application should accept user input.
The user should be prompted to enter up to three characters for the logo text.
The user should be prompted to enter the text color using a color keyword or a hexadecimal number.
The user should be presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square.
The user should be prompted to enter the shape color using a color keyword or a hexadecimal number.
Once the user has entered input for all the prompts, an SVG file named logo.svg should be created.
The output text "Generated logo.svg" should be printed in the command line.
When the logo.svg file is opened in a browser, it should display a 300x200 pixel image that matches the entered criteria.
